# 😴 Sleep Disorder Analysis Dashboard (Power BI Project)

## 📌 Project Purpose

This project focuses on analyzing sleep patterns, stress levels, and health indicators to uncover key insights related to **insomnia, sleep apnea, and overall sleep health**. The dashboard helps researchers, doctors, and wellness experts identify risk factors and improve interventions for better sleep quality.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Power BI Desktop**
* **Power Query (M)** for cleaning and shaping sleep data
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for calculated measures
* **Excel** as the source data file
* **Custom Visualization & Theming** (dark mode layout with vibrant contrast colors)

## 📊 Data Source

* **Format:** .xlsx
* **Rows:** \~600 (Sleep Study Records)
* **Columns:** Age, Gender, BMI Category, Occupation, Daily Steps, Sleep Disorder Type, Sleep Quality Score, Stress Level, Sleep Duration
* **Source:** Open-source sleep disorder dataset (public health dataset for research)

## ✨ Features & Highlights

### 🧩 5.1.1 Business Problem

Sleep disorders are a major contributor to poor health and productivity.
This project aims to:

* Quantify the prevalence of insomnia and sleep apnea
* Explore relationships between BMI, occupation, stress, and sleep quality
* Provide a clear visual representation of sleep health across demographics

### 🎯 5.1.2 Dashboard Goals

* Track insomnia & sleep apnea case counts
* Compare average sleep scores & durations
* Correlate sleep quality with stress levels across age groups
* Break down BMI and occupation distributions to spot risk patterns

### 📊 5.1.3 Key Visuals

**KPI Cards & Gauges:**

* Insomnia Cases (97) & Sleep Score (67.9)
* Sleep Apnea Cases (76) & Sleep Score (60.8)
* Average Sleep Duration (7.14h vs 6.36h)

**Line Charts:**

* Sleep Quality vs Stress Level across Age Groups

**Bar Charts:**

* Count of Individuals by BMI Category
* Average Daily Steps by Occupation
* Count of Person IDs by BMI Category

**Donut Chart:**

* Overall Sleep Health Status (36.89% affected)

**Slicers/Filters:**

* Gender-based view (Male/Female)

## 💼 5.1.4 Business Impact & Insights

* **36.89%** of individuals show poor sleep health, signaling a significant wellness concern
* **Insomnia prevalence (20.68%)** is slightly higher than sleep apnea (16.20%)
* Underweight and obese groups show higher disorder counts, linking BMI to sleep quality
* Students and manual laborers have higher daily step counts, but not necessarily better sleep scores — possible stress influence
* Stress levels rise steadily with age, affecting sleep quality beyond 40 years
